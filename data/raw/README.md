## 📁 `raw/` Folder

- This folder is used to store references to the original LendingClub datasets.
- Due to the size of the raw files, they are **not stored directly in the repository**.
- You can download them manually from the following source:

🔗 **[LendingClub Loan Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club)**

- Files you’ll need:
  - `accepted_2007_to_2018Q4.csv`
  - `rejected_2007_to_2018.csv`

> After downloading, place them in the `/data/raw/` directory to reproduce the SQL-based data cleaning steps.
